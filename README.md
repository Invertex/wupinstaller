<h1>Fix to work somewhat properly with 5.4</h1><br/>
I've merged the WUPinstaller code with the latest source of the ksploit that has a higher chance of succeeding the initial exploit phase.<br/>
As well added some instructional text for users, and changed the way the program exits to get around it erroring when you start the install.<br/><br/>

Current master build can only install WUPs on 5.4 that are very small, because it triggers an error very quickly that halts the installation.<br/>
So this is a temporary fix to get around that until someone with better tools and knowledge like crediar can properly repair it.<br/>
